# Project Mayday

People interested in aviation may benefit from a first hand experience of flying a plane; however, off-the-shelf simulators may prove to be too complicated or expensive. The Mayday flight simulator strikes a balance between physical accuracy and intuitive learning while also being a light program capable of running on lower end machines. While external components exist, they are not necessary for the experience.
